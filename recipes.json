Let jar and lid stand in hot water until ready to fill with Trial Batch.  Drain well before filling.  Repeat this procedure with jars needed for remmainder of batch.\r\n\r\n3.  Prepare Trial Batch\r\n\r\n    Measure jam or jelly (1 cup) into small (1 quart) saucepan.  Bring mixture to full rolling boil (a boil that doesn't stop bubbling when stirred) on high heat, stirring constantly.  Stir in above amounts of sugar, lemon juice, and Certo Fruit Pectin.  Return to full rolling boil on high heat, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Skim off any foam with metal spoon.\r\n\r\n   Quickly pour into prepared jar.  Cover and let stand up to 24 hours to check set of Trial Batch.\r\n\r\n   Store opened pouch of Certo Fruit Pectin in refrigerator.\r\n\r\n5.  Prepare remainder of batch.\r\n\r\n6.  Do not try to remake more that 8 cups of jam or jelly at one time.  If Trial Batch sets satisfactorily, follow recipe above, using the listed measures of sugar, lemon juice and Certo Fruit Pectin for EACH 1 cup of jam or jelly.  Measure jam or jelly into a large (6 to 8 quart) saucepot.  Bring to full rolling boil as directed; continue to boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Skim off any foam with metal spoon.  \r\n\r\nLadle quickly into prepared jars, filling to within 1/8 inch of tops.  Wipe jar rims and threads.  Cover with two-piece lids.  Screw bands tightly.  Invert jars 5 minutes, then turn upright.  Or follow water bath method recommended by USDA.  After jars are cool, check seals.\r\n\r\nAfter preparing remainder of batch, discard Certo Fruit Pectin in opened pouch.\r\n\r\n7.  For convenience in measuring larger amounts of sugar, lemon juice, and Certo:\r\n\r\n3   Teaspoons   =  1 Tablespoon\r\n8   Tablespoons =  1/2 cup\r\n16  Tablespoons = 1 cup\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember:  If your jam or jelly still doesn't set, you can always use it as a glaze or syrup!",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\r\n\r\n3.  Spoon a heaping tablespoon of beans down center of each tortilla, working with 1 tortilla at a time.  Top with 1/2 cup of chicken mixture.  Fold up bottom, top and sides of tortillas and secure with toothpicks.  Place chimichangas seam-side-down in a lightly greased 10x15 inch baking dish.  Brush sides with oil.\r\n\r\n4.  Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown and crisp, turning every five munutes.  Serve with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.\r\n\r\nNote:  My Recipe Adjustments:\r\n\r\n1.  I place boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a pan and sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and chili powder.  I bake them at 350 degrees until cooked through.\r\n\r\n2.  In the chicken mixture (see # 1 of original recipe) I use 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.\r\n\r\n3.

Brown chicken, about 4 min. per side; transfer to plate.\n3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, onion, and 1/2 tsp. salt and cook until softened, about 5 min. Stir in rice, garlic, and curry powder and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer.\n4. Nestle chicken into skillet along with any accumulated juices. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and cook until chicken registers 160 degrees, about 8 min. Transfer chicken to serving platter, brushing any rice that sticks to chicken back into skillet, and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let chicken rest while finishing rice.\n5. Add coconut milk to skillet, cover, and cook over medium- low heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 15 min. Off heat, sprinkle peas over rice, cover, and let sit until heated through, about 2 min. Gently fold cilantro (optional) and almonds into rice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken with rice.\nNote: I added more curry and almonds.\nNote: rice gets mushy if you mix too much. Tried basmati rice which worked better.",

Whisk in milk and onion powder.\r\n\r\nSpray 9x13 inch glass or ceramic baking dish with vegetable spray.  Scatter half Canadian bacon evenly in bottom of dish.  Scatter muffin cubes on top of Canadian bacon.  Top with remaining Canadian bacon, scattering it evenly over muffin cubes.  Pour egg mixture over casserole.  Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours, to let bread absorb egg mixture.\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees.\r\n\r\nRemove casserole from refrigerator, and uncover it.  Lightly sprinkle paprika evenly over top.  Cover casserole with foil and bake 40 minutes.  \r\n\r\nRemove dish from oven, remove foil, return dish to oven and continue to bake, uncovered, until the eggs are set and the bacon on top begins to crisp, about 20 minutes more.  Remove casserole from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving.\r\n\r\nTo serve, cut casserole into squares and place on individual plates.  Spoon warm Hollandaise sauce over each serving just before serving.  Makes 10 servings.\r\n\r\nEasy Hollandaise Sauce:\r\n\r\n1/2  Cup (1 stick) Butter\r\n4     Large Eggs\r\n1/2  Cup Whipping Cream\r\n2     Tablespoons Lemon Juice\r\n1     Teaspoon Dijon Mustard\r\n\r\nCut butter into 4 pieces and place in 1 quart glass measure or bowl and microwave, covered with paper towel, on high, until almost melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove butter from microwave and stir until completely melted.\r\n\r\nSeparate eggs, placing yolks in small bowl and setting whites aside for another purpose.\r\n\r\nBeat yolks well with whisk or fork, then add to butter and stir well.  Add cream and lemon juice to egg mixture and stir well.  Microwave mixture, uncovered, on high, until just slightly thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stopping every 20 seconds to stir with fork.\r\n\r\nRemove sauce from microwave and stir in mustard.  Makes about 1 1/2 cups.\r\n\r\nNote:  This sauce may be kept warm in a Thermos container up to 4 hours.  Or you can cool the sauce to room temperature and refrigerate it in a covered microwave-safe container for up to 24 hours.  To re-warm, cover the container with plastic wrap, pierce wrap with a knife to vent, and microwave on 50% power until heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to stir halfway through.  Do not allow sauce to boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:  I haven't tried the above Hollandaise recipe.  I use the recipe under \"sauces.\"",

Place medallions with the cut side up and press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly. Season the meat with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat 3 T oil and 1 T butter in a large skillet over high heat, somewhere between medium-high and high. You want a really hot pan, but not so hot that it will scorch.  When the butter is melted and foaming, add the meat and sear until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Don't over-crowd the pan.  Do in two batches, if necessary. Flip and cook the other side until the meat is well browned and slightly firm to the touch, about another 2 minutes. Transfer the pork to a plate. 3. Melt the remaining 2 T butter in the pan.  Add the shallots and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring for about 30 seconds, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the mushrooms and cook until all of the mushroom liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are golden, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the flour and add the Marsala.  Allow the Marsala to boil until almost completely evaporated.\n4.  Once the Marsala has almost completely evaporated, add the chicken broth and cook until the mixture is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the cream and parsley.  Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pan, and cook, flipping the pork once, until it is firm to the touch and still a little pink in the middle, 2 to 4 minutes.  Taste for salt and pepper and serve.  Serve garnished with additional parsley."

Add oyster sauce, pepper, sugar, salt, cornstarch mixture, eggs.\r\n7. Knead mixture in bowl until even.\r\n8. Wet the rice paper in the hot water (from step 1). Once it becomes pliable but not too sticky, fold 1/3 of paper down. This gives the roll a thicker area to spread the meat mixture on.\r\n9. Place meat mixture on folded rice paper, spread so that there is 1 inch of space on each of the ends. \r\n10. Fold the ends of the rice paper on top of the meat mixture.\r\n11. Roll it up, pulling the roll if necessary to make a firm wrap.\r\n12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 until all rice paper or meat mixture is gone.\r\n13. Poke rolls with toothpick liberally (this prevents them from blowing up in the fryer).\r\n14. Fry rolls in deep fryer at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until fryer is noticeably quieter (the water will have been cooked off � the water is what makes the fryer loud!).\r\n",
